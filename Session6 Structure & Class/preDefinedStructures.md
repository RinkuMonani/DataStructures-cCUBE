### Questions with Pre-defined structures

As we discussed in the session, some questions have pre-defined structure and you have to code your solution according to it.

For example, questions revolving around linked list generally provide the core strcuture of the linked list to you and you have to code the operations required to solve the problem strictly considering all the variales names and data type mentioned in the core structure.

*when I say structure, I don't just mean 'STRUCT'*

###### Here are some questions for your reference
We are yet to cover linked list in our sessions so do not be hard on yourself if you find these question definitions intriguing.

For now, feel free to read the questions and **go through code that is given to you already!**
